# facility-location-problem
we proposed and implemented the Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) algorithm for solving the facility allocation problem. 
The GEO algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that utilizes concepts from the behavior of golden eagles to explore and converge towards optimal or near-optimal solutions. The goal of the facility allocation problem is to assign customers to facilities in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the GEO algorithm in finding solutions that minimize the total cost of facility allocation. The algorithm performed iterative improvements by employing crossover and mutation operations on a population of solutions (eagles). By exploring the search space and leveraging the advantages of these operations, the algorithm successfully converged towards better solutions over iterations.

Our experimental results showcased the algorithm's capability to handle problem instances with 100 facilities and customers. The GEO algorithm was able to find a best solution that minimized the total cost of facility allocation. The performance analysis revealed that the algorithm's success depends on parameter settings such as the number of iterations, number of eagles, crossover probability, and mutation probability. Fine-tuning these parameters is crucial to optimize the algorithm's performance and solution quality
